          <p>We continued to the Soča river valley and into Triglav National Park (the Julian Alps). Soča river is known for it’s beautifully turquoise water and Triglav is known for it’s big peaks and adventure sports. Ze’ev and I started the day by biking an hour and 800 ft in the wrong direction, but we decided it was worth it because the road was so amazing and the views were incredible. We turned around, went back down the hill, and met up with Chase, Teagan and Ashley at our lunch spot along the Soča river. We picnicked, watched the river kayakers and paragliders, and took a refreshing swim in the river. The road continued climbing along the river through gorgeous meadows and towns filled with outdoor adventurers. We were getting higher into the mountains and we were loving Slovenia more and more.</p>

          <p>We woke up the next morning with slugs on our tents and with excitement to start the our big day of climbing. We were climbing up and over Veršič pass at 1611 meters (5,285 ft) via 25 switchbacks with 18% grades over 10 km. The climb was long and steep and filled with (really fast) road cyclists - more cyclists than I probably ever seen on one road. It was awesome. When we got near the top, people cheered for us. We did it! After stretching and eating an enormous picnic at the top, we continued 10 km downhill to stay at a hut that our other new friends (Mitch and Kate) had stayed at last week. Just as we arrived, it started pouring. The five of us showered, ordered hot soup and creamy gnocchi, and played cards. We went to bed feeling exhausted, full, and warm.</p>

          <p>On Saturday 7/21, we decided to take a rest day in the town at the base of the mountain, Kranjska Gora. It was supposed to rain all day, so we found a campground nearby, cooked enormous meals, got wifi, and did laundry. For lunch we made 20 eggs, 3 cups of rice and beans, bread and cheese, peppers, and onions. We also snagged 3 enormous cookies for dessert. For dinner we made grilled cheeses on a campfire grill and a huge salad. We were all buffed (beyond stuffed). It rained all night, but we were cozy in our tents.</p>
          <p>It finally came the day that Ze’ev and I would part ways with Chase, Teagan and Ashley: they would continue on to Italy and France, and we would go to Ljubljana.  It’d been such a fun 5 days biking with them, getting to know them, and laughing a lot. Hopefully we see them again. You can see Chase’s blog <a href='https://engineersonwheel.blogspot.com/'>here</a></p>
          <p>Now, Ze’ev and I are headed to Lake Bled, Lake Bohinj, and Ljubljana. We’re hoping for some more nice bike roads, less rain, and an enjoyable visit to the city!</p>
