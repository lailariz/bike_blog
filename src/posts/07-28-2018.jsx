          <p>{"For the next three days, we rode across Eastern Germany's extremely flat farm land through dried-up sunflower fields and on long, straight stretches of roads that seemed to go on for hours. It's fair to say that this was the most boring terrain of our whole tour."}</p>

	<p>{"Despite the uneventful scenery, it became of the most memorable parts of our trip, simply because of our Warm Showers hosts. Each night, we were greeted by the most generous and interesting people. They offered us meals, showed us around town and invited us into their homes. Each host was unique and had fascinating stories and memorable tips. The experiences with these Warm Showers hosts make me remember why traveling is so amazing and how wonderful humans can be."}</p>

        <p>{"After crossing the Czech/Germany border, we biked along the Elbe river path towards Dresden. It was Friday afternoon and the path was a madhouse: we must have passed 3 dozen bike tourers and even more day cyclists. Although quite crowded, we were pleased to be surrounded by other biking enthusiasts."}</p>

	<p>{"As soon as we arrived in Dresden, it began to pour. And I mean absolutely pour. Naturally, we took cover at a highly rated Eva’s Pizza and indulged ourselves in a delicious veggie pizza and slightly odd local, craft beer. The neighborhood we were in, Neustadt, had artsy shops, good looking cafes and lots of young people. Streets were covered in murals and intriguing art pieces. While only in Dresden for a couple hours, we liked the feel of this Eastern Germany city."}</p>

          <p>{"We had made plans to stay with a host in Meissen, which was about 20 km north of Dresden. The host was a family of four: Sven & Dorothy and their two kids Jakob (3) and Oskar (1). In 2010 Sven and Dorothy spent 2+ years biking from Patagonia to Alaska (WOW), so we were excited to meet them and hear about this grand adventure. We arrived at their house and were greeted by kids yelling and running around. Sven showed us the bathroom, kitchen, garden, and their \"Wagon\" guest house for the night. The wagon guest house was cozy and amazing: 2/3rds of it was a giant bed and the rest was just floor space. The wagon was elevated a couple feet the ground and the windows opened up to the trees in their yard. It felt like a luxurious tree house and we were very excited to sleep in it. We cooked dinner, shared biking stories with Sven and Doro, and Jakob (3) helped us cook and stir our food. After dinner, we sat on their porch for several hours chatting about biking, Germany and nature. They told us about their two year trip and also the 3-week trip they just went on last month through Estonia and Latvia with their kids (more wow)."}</p>

	<p>{"At about 10pm, Doro remembered that there was a lunar eclipse that would have the longest darkness in a million years. Upon remembering this, Sven grabbed his biked and told us we were going to bike to the top of the hill to see the moon. Even though it was at least 1.5 hours past our bedtime, we followed Sven up dark streets and on dirt roads, eventually to arrive at an overlook of the Elbe river and city of Dresden. Although the spot was slightly crowded, the view was amazing and the night sky even more beautiful. On a backdrop of dazzling stars, the moon was stunning with had a reddish tint to it. As we sat there listening to the hum or stargazers and watching the night sky, I felt an overwhelming sense of gratitude to be spending the evening with Sven and Doro's family."}</p>

          <p>{"The next day we began our 70km journey to the little town fo Finsterwalde, which was about 100km south of Berlin. We biked along the Elbe river, and then continued through the farmland and sunflower fields. Our next Warm Showers host, Gerd, said he would bike south on the road until we passed each other so that we would ride together until we reached his home. From our email messages, we knew Gerd didn't speak much English which made us question how the evening would go and if we’d be able to communicate."}</p>

          <p>{"Fortunately, the evening turned out to be absolutely amazing. Gerd and his wife were incredibly welcoming, served us a delicious pasta dinner and had contagious laughs. While their English wasn't great and our German was non-existent, we had little trouble communicating and enjoying each other's company. Gerd had an awesome silver Labrador named Bubba and was his "best friend". Bubba drooled when I fed him an apple, wrestled with Ze’ev and was incredible obedient. Gerd took Bubba, Ze’ev and I for a half hour walk to the woods and Bubba played fetch with the same stick the whole time. He’d run ahead, wait to cross the street until we all got there, and then we’d all walk together."}</p>

          <p>{"After dinner, Gerd asked us if we wanted another beer and if we wanted to play darts with them on their backyard dart court (lol). We obviously said yes. Gerd quickly proved that he was an expert at darts and not surprisingly, won the first game with flying colors. He then asked if we wanted another beer and to play again. Feeling my competitive spirit kick in, we agreed to a third(?) round of beers and a second game of darts. In his broken English, Gerd added he would buy breakfast for the winner. We laughed, all knowing that he would just be buying breakfast for himself. But guess what? I won. And guess what I said I wanted for breakfast? Ice cream."}</p>

          <p>{"Sure enough, the next morning at 7:30am sharp we sat down for breakfast with bread, cheese, jam and a jar of ice cream. This is potentially my biggest win of the entire summer."}</p>
