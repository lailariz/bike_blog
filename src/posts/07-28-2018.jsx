        <p>{"After crossing the Czech/Germany border, we biked along the Elbe river path towards Dresden. It was Friday afternoon and the path was a madhouse: we must have passed 3 dozen bike tourers and even more day cyclists. In Dresden, it began to pour so we took cover at a highly rated Eva’s Pizza. We also bought a beer at a fancy craft beer store to compliment our veggie pizza. The neighborhood that we visited in Dresden, Neustadt, had artsy shops, good looking cafes and lots of young people walking around. There was also some sweet architecture on the apartment walls. We were only in Dresden for a couple hours, but we liked the feel of this Germany city. We were happy to be back in Germany."}</p>

          <p>{"We had plans to stay with a host in Meissen, which was about 20 km north of Dresden. The host was a family of four: Sven & Dorothy and their two kids Jakob (3) and Oskar (1). In 2010 Sven and Dorothy spent 2+ years biking from Patagonia to Alaska, so we were excited to meet them and hear about this grand adventure. We arrived at their house and were greeted by kids yelling and running around. Sven showed us the bathroom, kitchen, garden, and their \"Wagon\" guest house for the night. The wagon guest house was cozy and amazing: 2/3rds of it was a giant bed and the rest was just floor space. The wagon was elevated a couple feet the ground and the windows opened up to the trees in their yard. It felt like a luxurious tree house and we were very excited to sleep in it. We cooked dinner, shared biking stories with Sven and Doro, and Jakob (3) helped us cook and stir our food. After dinner, we sat on their porch for a couple hours chatting about biking, Germany and nature. They told us about their two year trip and also the 3-week trip they just went on last month through Estonia and Latvia with their kids. Wow. At about 10pm, Doro remembered that there was a lunar eclipse tonight that would have the longest darkness in a million years. Sven grabbed his biked and told us we were going to bike to the top of the hill to see the moon. So, we followed him up the dark streets and on some dirt roads to an overlook of the Elbe river and Dresden. There were about 20 other people already there watching and it was beautiful. The moon was dark and had a reddish tint to it. The stars were glowing. I felt lucky to be spending the night with Sven and Doro because Ze’ev and I definitely would have not known about the eclipse and slept right through it. This was just one of the benefits of staying with local hosts. We went to sleep happy and cozy in the Wagon :)"}</p>

          <p>{"The next day we began our 70km journey to the little town fo Finsterwalde, which was about 100km south of Berlin. We biked along the Elbe river, and then continued through the farmland and sunflower fields. Our Warm Showers host, Gerd, said he would bike south on the road until we passed each other and we would ride together for a bit. From our email messages with Gerd, we could tell he didn’t speak much english so were curious about how the evening would go and if we’d be able to communicate. Fortunately, the evening was amazing and Gerd and his wife were incredible hosts. Gerd and his wife were incredibly welcoming, served us a delicious pasta dinner and had contagious laughs. Gerd also had an awesome silver Labrador named Bubba, who he said was his best friend. Bubba drooled when I fed him an apple, wrestled with Ze’ev and was incredible obedient. Gerd took Bubba, Ze’ev and I for a half hour walk to the woods and Bubba played fetch with the same stick the whole time. He’d run ahead, wait to cross the street until we all got there, and then we’d all walk together. "}</p>
          <p>{"After dinner, Gerd asked us if we wanted another beer and if we wanted to play darts. We did. Gerd won the first game, and then asked if we wanted another beer and to play again. We said yes. This time, he said that he would buy breakfast for the winner. I said if I won I wanted ice cream for breakfast. Sure enough, I won. So, the next morning we sat down for at 8am with bread, cheese, jam and a jar of ice cream. We all laughed a lot."}</p>
