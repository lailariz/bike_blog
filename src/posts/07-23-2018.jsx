          <p>{"The rain continued sporadically after our departure from Triglav National Park. We were planning to spend a day exploring Bled Lake and Bohinj Lake, but it was too rainy to bike and camp outside. We stopped for a quick picnic at the touristy but picturesque Bled Lake while the sun was still out, but it began to pour on our 25 km bike ride to Bojinj lake. We took refuge under an awning of a house in a small village and waited it out before continuing on to find a place to sleep. We found a “Sobe” (room for rent in ljubljanaenian) a couple kilometers outside of Bohinj and called it good. While the room was big and the bed was comfy, this home had a lot of weird cats and the mom was constantly yelling at her teenage daughter in ljubljanaenian. It’s interesting to hear their impatient tone and see their frustrated facial expressions, but have no idea what they were yelling about. At one point the mom turned to me and rolled her eyes and said “ugh, teenagers”."}</p>

          <p>{"The next day had again, very beautiful scenery through mountain towns and apple orchards, but it was slow biking because our bikes needed some maintenance. In the morning we spent several hours doing some bike repair (changing Ze’ev’s wheel, tube and cable) and later during the day we each got another flat tire that we needed to patch.  We finally made it to the house of our warm showers host, Robin, just outside of Ljubljana. He was a quiet, middle aged man who lived in a beautiful flat. He’s biked in more than 50 countries and hosted more than 500 Warm Showers guests in his home! He runs marathons, is vegan and clearly lives a very simple and healthy life. Robin cooked us a delicious barley vegetable soup and a cucumber tomato salad; it was really nice to have home cooked food that was healthy and simple. He told us about his bike adventures around the world, showed us some photos, and shared his upcoming adventures in Madagascar. We slept in his guest bedroom on a very squeaky bed that woke me up each time one of us rolled over. Nonetheless, I was grateful for our stay with Robin. At 7:30 the next morning, he biked with us to downtown Ljubljana and we dropped him off at work."}</p>

          <p>{"We stayed in Ljubljana for two days and absolutely loved it. It’s a small town along a little river, with cobblestone streets that only pedestrians and bikes are allowed on. Cafes were bustling and the daily farmers market was full of fresh, colorful fruits and veggies. There are at least 6 bridges crossing the river, each with a different style and feel. For example, one is covered with 16 dragons and another with padlocks that people put up to symbolize their love. The statue in the main square is of a ljubljanaenia poet, France Prešerengg, who wrote their national anthem and romantic songs. We went on the free walking tour, went to an awesome exhibit at the Ethnographic Museum, and ate delicious (and cheap!) meals at restaurants called Second Guitar and Abi Falafel. Finally, we ate the best ice cream (from a place called Vigó) that I’ve ever had. We liked it so much that bought ice cream 3 times during these 48 hours. In the evening, we climbed to the castle on the top of the hill to watch a movie on a big screen that they put up every night."}</p>

          <p>{"Next we are taking an overnight bus to Prague. From there we begin the last section of our bike adventure: 5 days (400 km) to bike from Prague to Berlin. We’ve organized our route to stay with Warm Showers host each night. I can’t believe how fast this month has gone by. It’s incredible how many people we’ve met and how many places we’ve seen. While I’m excited to have a more permanent place to stay for a week and feel cleaner and less smelly, I’m sad that the biking portion of our Europe journey is ending. Bike touring is such an incredible and affordable way to see the world and I feel grateful to have had the opportunity to do this."}</p>
